            In recent years, the proliferation of deepfake technology has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and 
            digital security. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning-based system for detecting deepfake videos and 
            images. We utilize a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze 
            both spatial and temporal features of multimedia content.<br>
            Our approach begins with a comprehensive dataset of authentic and manipulated media. We preprocess the data to enhance 
            feature extraction and then train our model on this dataset. The system evaluates visual artifacts, inconsistencies in 
            facial expressions, and subtle anomalies that typically characterize deepfakes.<br>
            We assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Initial results 
            demonstrate promising detection rates, indicating that our method can effectively distinguish between genuine and 
            altered media. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the development of tools that help mitigate the impact 
            of deepfakes, fostering a more trustworthy digital environment.

                In the digital age, the rise of artificial intelligence has led to the creation of highly realistic manipulated media 
                known as deepfakes. These synthetic videos and images use advanced algorithms to alter appearances and voices, making 
                it increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction. While deepfake technology has legitimate applications in 
                entertainment and education, it also poses significant risks, including misinformation, identity theft, and potential 
                political manipulation.<br>
                As the prevalence of deepfakes grows, so does the need for effective detection methods. Traditional techniques 
                for identifying manipulated media are often inadequate, given the rapid advancements in deepfake creation. This 
                project focuses on leveraging machine learning to develop a reliable detection system that can identify deepfake 
                content with high accuracy.
