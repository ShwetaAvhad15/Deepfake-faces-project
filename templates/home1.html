                      The advent of deepfake technology has transformed the landscape of digital media, enabling the creation of hyper-realistic 
                      videos and images that can convincingly manipulate reality. This technology harnesses deep learning algorithms, particularly 
                      generative adversarial networks (GANs), to synthesize media that can impersonate individuals, alter speech, or fabricate events. 
                      While these capabilities have fascinating applications in entertainment, film, and art, they also pose significant threats in the 
                      realms of misinformation, fraud, and cybersecurity.<br>
                      By employing various machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks 
                      (RNNs), we aim to analyze the subtle cues that differentiate genuine media from its altered counterparts. Our goal is not only 
                      to enhance detection capabilities but also to contribute to broader efforts in safeguarding information integrity in the digital 
                      landscape. Through this research, we aspire to provide tools that empower users to discern the authenticity of the media they 
                      consume and share.

                      Detecting deepfakes presents unique challenges due to the rapid advancements in the techniques used to create them. 
                      Many existing detection methods rely on detecting artifacts or inconsistencies that may not always be present in newer 
                      deepfake technologies. Furthermore, as deepfake creators continuously improve their techniques, detection systems must 
                      evolve in tandem to maintain efficacy.<br>
                      Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness 
                      of the ML and DL approaches. The results aim to demonstrate the potential of these technologies to provide real-time 
                      deepfake face detection, offering both beginners and experienced practitioners a valuable tool 
                      for improving their technique and preventing securites.
